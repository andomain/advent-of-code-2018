# advent-of-code-2018
My solutions to the 2018 advent of code in Node.js.
For all solutions run `yarn` to install dependencies then `yarn start`.
N.b. where possible vanilla Node/Javascript is used with no dependencies/packages etc.

1. Chronal Calibration

    Take an array of values, calculate the final result & detect first duplicates

2. Inventory Management System

    Parse an array of strings looking for duplicates and similarities

3. No Matter How You Slice It

    Generate 2D arrays of claims and detect overlaps

4. Repose Record

    Convert timestamped data and detect frequency of time periods
