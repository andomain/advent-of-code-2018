# advent-of-code-2018
My solutions to the 2018 advent of code in Node.js.
For all solutions run `yarn` to install dependencies then `yarn start`.
N.b. where possible vanilla Node/Javascript is used with no dependencies/packages etc. 

1. Chronal Calibration

   Take an array of values, calculate the final result & detect first duplicates

2. Inventory Management System

    Parse an array of strings looking for duplicates and similarities
