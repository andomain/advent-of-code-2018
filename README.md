Advent of Code Solutions

## 2019
I have decided to use this years AoC to practise my Typescript skills.
I also tried to build up a library of reusable components to use throughout the solutions as this is something I observed last year.
These components can be found in the `./utils` directory.

### Setup
```
cd 2019
yarn
```

### Run a solutions
I have used ts-node to run the solutions.
```
cd 2019
npx ts-node <DAY_NUMBER>
```

## 2018
I have included my 2018 solutions for reference but due to time constraints I had to bail out of completing this.
Solutions can be run using the corresponding npm scripts
